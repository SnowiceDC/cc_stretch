## Welcome to cc_stretch

This repository was created to provide some challenges in the skills necessary for a sysadmin that need programming skills.

#### Operating System to Use

I prefer to use an unix OS to administrate systems, the OS's like linux and FreeBSD provide a lot of tools to connect in ssh sessions, edit files and manipulate data. I usually install FreeBSD in servers and Linux [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/pt_BR/) in the desktop and notebook to produce my work.

The challanges can be resolve by using Windows, but i will not comment about this, sorry!

#### Shell

We will use shell scripts to create profiles and environment vars file

#### Python

Python is so much easy to learn and a powerfull language to administrate operating systems like linux, FreeBSD and Windows.

We will use ansible to administrate some remote services.

### How the hell this repository will works?

For each directory here, a challange will be available to be executed, to participate each person must create a fork of this repository and resolve the challange, making a pull request with of the resolved challange as your way.

### [jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Jupyter notebook is a powerful tool to teach coding skills, it provide a line of a shell to execute commands and the results step.

#### First Steps

Bellow have the steps to create a virtual environment aparted of your OS to play with the challange, including the installation of the jupyter notebook.
